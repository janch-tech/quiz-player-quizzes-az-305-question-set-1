    "question": "You are migrating a high-performance OLTP database to Azure SQL Database. The solution must provide the **lowest possible latency** and **highest IOPS** using locally-attached SSD storage. Select the correct database type AND service tier.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Support for zone-redundant configuration\n- 99.99% availability SLA\n- Lowest latency for I/O operations (using local SSDs)",

        }
    ],
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **A single Azure SQL database** in the **Business Critical** service tier.\n\nWhile both **Hyperscale** and **Business Critical** tiers now support zone redundancy and a 99.99% SLA, the **Business Critical** tier is specifically architected for applications requiring the **lowest latency** and **highest IOPS**. This is achieved by using **locally-attached SSDs** for data and log files, unlike Hyperscale's distributed remote storage architecture, which may introduce slightly higher latency.",
