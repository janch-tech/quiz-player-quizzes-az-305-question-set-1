    "question": "You are designing the identity strategy for Stratos Retail. The company plans to migrate to a hybrid identity model to support Microsoft 365 while maintaining legacy application access to the prod.stratos.com forest. Which two actions should you include in the recommendation? (Choose two.)",

        }
    ],
    "explanation": "To support Microsoft 365 while maintaining legacy access in a hybrid model, two key steps are required:\n\n1. **Install Microsoft Entra Connect**: This is the essential tool for synchronizing identities from the on-premises AD forest (prod.stratos.com) to Microsoft Entra ID, enabling a single identity for users across both environments.\n2. **Deploy Domain Controllers in Azure**: By extending the prod.stratos.com forest into Azure via VMs in a VNet, applications hosted in Azure can authenticate locally even if the VPN/ExpressRoute link to on-premises fails.\n\n- Decommissioning on-premises DCs would break local legacy access.\n- Multiple tenants increase management complexity and fragment identity.\n- Over-assigning the Global Administrator role violates the principle of least privilege.",
