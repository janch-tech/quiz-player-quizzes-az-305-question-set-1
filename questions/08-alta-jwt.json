    ],
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **Azure API Management**.\n\nAzure API Management allows you to configure inbound policies to validate JWT tokens before requests reach your backend APIs. This provides a centralized security layer at the API gateway, which is specifically what the case study requires ('JWT tokens must be validated at the API gateway level').\n\n- Microsoft Entra ID issues and signs JWT tokens but does not validate them at the API level.\n- While backend APIs should also perform their own token validation as a defense-in-depth measure, the question asks about the primary gateway-level configuration, making API Management the correct answer.",
