    "explanation": "The correct answer is **Use Microsoft Entra ID Governance entitlement management**.\n\nEntitlement management enables you to define access packages with approval workflows for external users. This provides governed, auditable access to applications for users in other Microsoft Entra ID tenants.\n\n- Device join is for managing devices, not application access for external users.\n- Pass-through authentication is for authenticating on-premises AD users, not cross-tenant access.\n- PIM manages privileged role assignments within an organization, not external user access.",
