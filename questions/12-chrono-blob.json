        "Revoke access by deleting or modifying the Stored Access Policy"
    ],
    "explanation": "The correct process for using Stored Access Policies is:\n\n1. **Create Policy**: Define the Stored Access Policy on the container level. This policy holds the start time, expiry time, and permissions.\n2. **Generate SAS**: Create the SAS token but DO NOT embed the expiry/permissions in the token itself; instead, reference the Policy ID (SignedIdentifier).\n3. **Distribute**: Give the SAS to the client.\n4. **Revoke**: If needed, you can simply delete or change the Stored Access Policy on the container. This immediately invalidates all SAS tokens linked to it without needing to rotate the storage account keys.",
