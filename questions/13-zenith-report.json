        }
    ],
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **Azure Resource Graph**. \n\n- **Azure Resource Graph** allows you to query at scale across all subscriptions and management groups. It specifically supports querying deployment data from the `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/deployments` or `Microsoft.Resources/deployments` resources, making it the most efficient way to generate cross-subscription reports.\n- Activity Logs only store 90 days of history by default, and querying them across hundreds of subscriptions is less efficient than Resource Graph.- Advisor provides suggestions, not deployment history.- Policy audits configuration state, not deployment operations.",
