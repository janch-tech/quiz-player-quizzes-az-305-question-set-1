    ],
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **Use the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) to perform an online migration**.\n\n- **Azure DMS (online mode)** is the primary recommendation for migrating SQL Server workloads to Azure SQL services with minimal downtime. It uses a continuous sync process that allows for a cutover with near-zero data loss and minimal disruption.\n- BACPAC export/import requires the database to be offline or read-only during the process, leading to significant downtime.\n- Azure Site Recovery is for DR and VM migration, not for migrating to PaaS services like Azure SQL Database.\n- Restoring from a URL is supported for Azure SQL Managed Instance, but for a standard Azure SQL Database, DMS is the superior choice for minimizing downtime.",
