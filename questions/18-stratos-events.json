        }
    ],
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **Azure Event Grid**. \n\n- **Azure Event Grid** is a highly scalable, serverless event broker that uses a **push-based** model to deliver events. It is designed for reactive, event-driven architectures with near-instant delivery.\n- Service Bus and Queue Storage use a **pull-based** model (polling).- Event Hubs is for massive data streaming and is typically consumed via a pull model (e.g., by Azure Stream Analytics or Event Hub SDK).",
