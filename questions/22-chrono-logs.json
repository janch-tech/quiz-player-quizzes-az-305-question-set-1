            "text": "A linked storage account for the Log Analytics workspace",

            "correct": true
        }
    ],
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **An Azure Monitor data collection endpoint**.\n\nData Collection Endpoints (DCEs) are the network entry points used by Azure Monitor Agent to send data. They work together with Data Collection Rules (DCRs), which define what data to collect, how to transform it, and where to send it. The DCE handles the ingestion endpoint, while the DCR handles the transformation logic.\n\n- A linked storage account is used for exporting query results or ingesting custom logs, not for VM log ingestion.\n- Private endpoints provide network isolation but don't handle log ingestion or transformation.",
