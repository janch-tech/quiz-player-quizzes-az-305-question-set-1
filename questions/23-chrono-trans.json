    "question": "Before storing logs in Log Analytics, you need to transform and filter the data. What query language should you use in the Data Collection Rule transformation?",
    "options": [
        {
            "text": "KQL (Kusto Query Language)",

            "correct": false
        }
    ],
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**.\n\nData Collection Rules support ingestion-time transformations using KQL. This allows you to filter, transform, and enrich data before it's stored in the Log Analytics workspace.\n\n- WQL is for querying Windows Management Instrumentation, not Azure Monitor.\n- XPath is for querying XML documents and is used in Event Log collection for filtering, but not for data transformation in DCRs.",
